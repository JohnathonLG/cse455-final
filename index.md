## The Problem

Stock and cryptocurrency traders consider a wide array of information in their work. One of the critical tools in their toolbox is Technical Analysis. This involves analyzing
charts on various time scales, looking for specific patterns. In particular, a common form of price chart is known as a "candlestick" chart, which breaks up the plot into
bars for each time interval (1 min, 5 min, 15 min, 1 hr, 1 day, etc). Each bar indicates the opening price, closing price, max, and min for that interval. The color
of the "body" of the bar indicates the bearish or bullish movement.

Additionally, traders consider many other types of data on their plots as well, such as:
- Trading Volume: The amount/value of trading that occurred over the time interval on that particular asset.
- Moving averages: For a clearer view of trends.
- Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): A special type of chart showing the relationship between two different exponential moving averages (EMAs).
- Relative Strength Indicator (RSI): A metric which describes whether an asset is considered "overbought" or "oversold." A similar but subtley different way of showing price momentum.

and many more. In all of these charts, traders seek to identify patterns, which could give hints for future movements. Such patterns can be very common, and very strong
indicators. In fact, they are frequently given names. The inspiration for this project was to see if a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) could perform the same task,
identifying patterns and predicting short-term movement.
